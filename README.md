# docker-tikaserver

This image is forked from logical spark, for removing unused installations and not version pinned software usage.
(Ubuntu:latest and the docker image in general)

Also we reduced the size of the container by using the openjdk - version pinned - and as minimal image. Take a look at the Dockerfile

Example docker usage

`docker run -it mindsmash/coyo-tika:1.14`
